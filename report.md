Of course! I'd be happy to remind you about the hotel suggestions and your initial budget for your Shenzhen trip.

Your initial budget for accommodation was **RM 1,300 for 1 night**.

Here are the hotel options I suggested, keeping that budget in mind for you and your two children:

1.  **Hotel Indigo Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town by IHG**
    *   **Budget:** RM 100–150/night
    *   **Notes:** This is a family-friendly option and is conveniently located near attractions like Window of the World.

2.  **Senmei International Apartment Hostel (Shenzhen Window of the World)**
    *   **Budget:** RM 80–120/night
    *   **Notes:** This is a budget-friendly choice and is also very close to the attractions.

Both options are well within your RM 1,300 budget for a one-night stay. Let me know if you need any more details!
