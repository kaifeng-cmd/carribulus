### **💡 Practical Tips for a Budget Trip to Tokyo**

*   **Suica/Pasmo Card:** Get a rechargeable IC card (Suica or Pasmo) immediately upon arrival. It makes using public transport incredibly convenient – just tap and go. You can also use it at some vending machines and convenience stores.
*   **Google Maps:** Essential for navigating Tokyo's complex public transport system. It provides accurate routes, times, and platform numbers.
*   **Cash is King (for small purchases):** While cards are accepted in many places, smaller shops, street vendors, and some local eateries may be cash-only. Always carry some yen.
*   **Konbini (Convenience Stores):** Embrace them! They offer excellent quality, affordable meals (onigiri, bento, sandwiches, fried chicken), snacks, and drinks. Great for breakfast and quick lunches.
*   **Supermarket Discounts:** Look for supermarkets (Life, Summit, Aeon) in residential areas. Many offer discounts on pre-made meals (bento, sushi) after 7 PM.
*   **Free Wi-Fi:** Many hotels, major train stations, and some public areas offer free Wi-Fi. Consider renting a portable Wi-Fi device or buying a local SIM card if you need constant connectivity, but factor this into your budget.
*   **Walking:** Tokyo is very walkable. Plan your days to group attractions in the same area to minimize transport costs and maximize steps!
*   **Cultural Etiquette:** Japan has unique customs. Remember to bow slightly, avoid loud conversations on public transport, don't eat while walking, and don't tip. Learning a few basic Japanese phrases like "Arigato gozaimasu" (Thank you) will be appreciated.
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Carry a water bottle. Convenience stores also offer affordable drinks.
*   **No Public Bins:** Public trash cans are scarce. Be prepared to carry your trash until you find one or return to your accommodation.
