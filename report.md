### 💡 Practical Tips

1.  **Transport:** To maintain the budget, stick to walking within the center and utilizing the local Perak Transit bus for the trip to Tasik Cermin. Have small Ringgit notes (MYR 1, MYR 5) ready for bus fares, as drivers rarely have change.
2.  **Cash is King:** Most traditional food stalls and smaller vendors only accept cash. Ensure you have small denominations for efficiency.
3.  **Dress Code:** While exploring the cave areas near Tasik Cermin, comfortable walking shoes are essential. If you pass by any temples, ensure modest dressing (shoulders and knees covered) is observed.
4.  **Hydration:** Ipoh is hot! Use part of your MYR 14 buffer to purchase bottled water throughout the day.
