Dear traveler,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm here to help you plan a wonderful trip. You're looking for a 2-day trip to Hatyai, Thailand, next week (December 1st-2nd, 2025), with a budget of RM430, and you love street food and massage.

However, I have received some urgent and critical information regarding the situation in Hatyai that I need to share with you immediately.

### ⚠️ **URGENT SAFETY ALERT: SEVERE FLOODING IN HATYAI** ⚠️

Our Travel News & Safety Analyst has reported that **Hatyai is currently experiencing severe and widespread flooding**, which has led to significant disruptions and safety concerns. This situation is highly critical and will impact any travel plans for December 1st and 2nd, 2025.

*   **Severe Flooding:** Hatyai and Songkhla provinces have faced "the most severe rain in nearly 300 years" as of November 25, 2025.
*   **Emergency & Evacuations:** Authorities have declared a flood emergency and issued "red flag" evacuation orders for 103 communities in Hat Yai district.
*   **Airport Closure:** Hat Yai International Airport was temporarily closed due to severe flooding that submerged its runway and surrounding areas. While there's an expected improvement in weather, floodwaters are still present, and the region is recovering from extensive damage.
*   **Stranded Travelers:** Thousands of visitors were recently stranded in hotels and at Hat Yai airport due to the floods.
*   **Travel Advisory:** Due to the ongoing severe flooding, infrastructure damage, and potential for continued disruption, **non-essential travel to Hatyai for December 1st and 2nd, 2025, is strongly discouraged.** You should expect significant delays, cancellations, and limited access to services.

**Given this critical situation, my strongest recommendation is to postpone your trip to Hatyai until the flood situation has fully subsided and the city has recovered.** Your safety and well-being are my top priority, and a "wonderful trip" would simply not be possible under these circumstances.

2.  **Consider an Alternative Destination:** If you are set on traveling next week, we can explore other destinations that fit your budget and interests in street food and massage, but are not affected by severe weather.
